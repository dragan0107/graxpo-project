# **Graxpo landing page project.**

## [Click here for demo.](https://drip016.github.io/graxpo-project/page/index.html)

> ### In this project, I was provided with a full page design in a PSD format, with all the fonts, colors, images and other assets, and my task was to recreate it from scratch.

### For this project, I used: **HTML, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript.** I also used **MasonryJS** library for the grid layout.

- Page is fully responsive and displays well on _mobile, tablet and smaller screens._
